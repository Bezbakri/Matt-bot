Speedrunning,"I was thinking about why so many in the radical left participate in ""speedrunning""\n\nThe reason is the left's lack of work ethic ('go fast' rather than 'do it right') and, in a Petersonian sense, to elevate alternative sexual archetypes in the marketplace ('fastest mario') 1/14"

Kosovo,"Kosovo is the subject of a territorial dispute between the Republic of Kosovo and the Republic of Serbia. The Republic of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence on 17 February 2008. Serbia continues to claim it as part of its own sovereign territory. The two governments began to normalise relations in 2013, as part of the 2013 Brussels Agreement. Kosovo is currently recognised as an independent state by 97 out of the 193 United Nations member states. In total, 112 UN member states have recognised Kosovo at some point, of which 15 later withdrew their recognition."

Hololive dating (fuck you elise),"Is incorporating Hololive characters into the date too weird?\nPretty much as title says. I (25m) have been seeing a girl (23f) for just over a month. We have been on 3 dates and things are going well. We have good chat, which includes private jokes. One of these jokes centres around our mutual love of Hololive (not going to get into it) which gets referenced a lot. Anyway, my plan for our next date is to take her to dinner at one of the nicest restraunts near us, followed by walk down the riverside. I have a 10 year old nephew who is also local to the area. After dinner, when we're on our walk, I want to (with her parents permission) get her to dress up as Uruha Rushia and approach us at 'random', demanding to have the ""rabbit"" (the girl im seeing). I will then pop my Korone cosplay on and swoop in, crazy dog lifting her (Pekora) away from her (Rushia) and roaring ""what are yee doin with ma rabbit?"" (part of our private joke) in my best Korone voice. I may also bring a few dog snacks in my rucksack to chuck at her for further comic effect. I excitedly told my friend about my plan the other day and he had his concerns :/ Is hololive role play really that weird? It is our 4th date?"

shit sponge,"oh my gosh imagine the smell of her hands after handling the shit sponge. the scent, the taste, i could spend hours thinking about the delicacy that is the furthest extremities sprouting from her upper torso. the way she holds that shit sponge is so aesthetically pleasing for my naked eyes, it truly excites my brain chemistry like nothing else"

AITA for not showing up to my own funeral?,AITA for not showing up to my own funeral?\n\nSo I (74M) was recently hit by a car (2014 Honda) and died. My wife (5F) organized me a funeral (cost $2747) without asking me (74M) at all. I (74M) was unable to make it because I (74M) was dead (17 days). At the funeral I heard my dad (15M) and other family members talking about how they wish I could be there and now I feel bad for not showing up. AITA?\n\nEdit: u/RadGlitch (6 years old) and an anonymous Reddit user are NTA for giving me gold (500 Reddit coins) and platinum (1800 Reddit coins)

Musket for home defence,"Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. ""What the devil?"" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, ""Tally ho lads"" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended."

edating,"can we honestly e date? you're so beautiful. You always make me laugh, you always make me smile. You literally make me want to become a better person... I really enjoy every moment we spend together. My time has no value unless its spent with you. I tell everyone of my irls how awesome you are. Thank you for being you. Whenever you need someone to be there for you, know that i'll always be right there by your side. I love you so much. I don't think you ever realize how amazing you are sometimes. Life isn't as fun when you're not around. You are truly stunning. I want you to be my soulmate. I love the way you smile, your eyes are absolutely gorgeous. If I had a star for everytime you crossed my mind i could make the entire galaxy. Your personality is as pretty as you are and thats saying something. I love you, please date me. I am not even calling it e dating anymore because I know we will meet soon enough heart OK I ADMIT IT I LOVE YOU OK i fucking love you and it breaks my heart when i see you play with someone else or anyone commenting in your profile i just want to be your boyfriend and put a heart in my profile linking to your profile and have a walltext of you commenting cute things i want to play video games talk in discord all night andw atch a movie together but you just seem so uninsterested in me it fucking kills me and i cant take it anymore i want to remove you but i care too much about you so please i'm begging you to eaither love me back or remove me and never contact me again it hurts so much to say this because i need you by my side but if you dont love me then i want you to leave because seeing your icon in my friendlist would kill me everyday of my pathetic life."

Greggnog,"My (24F) Boyfriend (27M) will not stop calling his cum ""Greggnog"" During Christmas time\n\nFirst off: I am not joking. I wish I was joking.\n\nI've been with my wonderful boyfriend Greg for over 4 years now, and this Christmas will be our third spent together. He's so much fun to be around, handsome, charming, and our sex life is great. Except for one small problem.\n\nEvery year now starting in December he starts referring to his cum as ""Greggnog."" When I first heard him say this, it was in the context of a joke, so I laughed, and then I forgot about it. A few days after this, we're exchanging some spicy texts before he gets home from work he says to me, in all seriousness, ""I can't wait to pour Greggnog all over your face."" I could not believe he just said that to me, but I didn't know what else to do at the time but go along with it.\n\nFast forward to this December. This phrase re-enters his vocabulary at the same time every year. It makes me cringe beyond belief, but until this year he used it sparingly enough for me to just be able to laugh and say ""shut the fuck up."" \n\nI'm sure that 2020 has done at least some irreparable psychic damage to all people, but unfortunately, for my boyfriend, this has manifested in the form of him referring to his cum as ""Greggnog"" non-stop. This month he has been using the term almost exclusively, in all contexts, and it is driving me batshit insane. I sat him down to talk last week, and I asked him very clearly and directly to stop. At the time, he said he would, and it did slow down for a few days, but it is now days before Christmas and he's back at it again with no end in sight.\n\nHe absolutely means the world to me, and I saw myself spending the rest of my life with him, but I have serious doubts now whether or not I can if every Christmas is going to be like this. So please, reddit, what do I do to make this stop for good?"

Why Suisei is perfect (fuck you again elise),"There's a reason why we'd be attracted to Suisei, and it's not the reason you'd think, so basically I put Suisei's voice through audio spectrum analysis. 1/f noise has spectral density that can be described with S(f)=k/fAa, where ""k"" is a constant, ""f"" is frequency and ""a"" is the exponent of the frequency. When a=1, it's considered the canonical case of pink noise (Pink noise reduces the difference between the background hum and loud, jarring noises that jolt you out of sleep, like a door slamming, a car horn honking, or someone snoring), although it's generally considered a 1/f fluctuation for 0.9<a<1.1. My analysis found that Suisei's voice averages a=1.004 across multiple songs. 1/ f patterns are found all throughout the natural world, in the human heartbeat, the nucleus of an atom, even the aging of C. elegans. Some people theorise that certain pieces of music are enjoyable because they emulate patterns that exist in nature, even if the listeners don't consciously know it. Essentially, Suisei's voice is exceptionally close to imitating this fluctuation, which could be a reason why we enjoy her music so much. Put simply, Suisei's voice is mathematically perfect."

Source?,"Do you have a source on that?\n\nSource?\n\nA source. I need a source.\n\nSorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.\n\nNo, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.\n\nYou can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.\n\nDo you have a degree in that field?\n\nA college degree? In that field?\n\nThen your arguments are invalid.\n\nNo, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.\n\nCorrelation does not equal causation.\n\nCORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.\n\nYou still haven't provided me a valid source yet.\n\nNope, still haven't.\n\nI just looked through all 308 pages of your user history, figures I'm debating a glormpf supporter.

Roxanne Wolf FNAF,"Roxanne Wolf is so hot. Never in the history of gaming has there been a hotter character. She is more than a robot wolf to me, she is a person. She is a little tease but she's basically my wife. The devs know what they did with that wolf. The aesthetic paired with her demeanor make her such an attractive character. Nothing gets me going better than a punk rock wolf chick. Every inch of her is so hot. Her thighs up to her midriff and her eyes. Every inch of her is perfection incarnate. I would save the game and let her catch me just to feel the intimacy between us. I crave more than lustful fantasies with her, I seek deep romantic involvement. The craftmanship of her character surpasses everything I expected from this game. Her tone of voice and language choice formats her character. The choice of clothes with short shorts and the crop top which reveal her milky thighs and delectable midriff compliment her punk rock personality more. She is my wife, and nothing dissuades me from this"

Tragedy of Darth Plagueis (kill me for adding a star wars copypasta),"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

Among us,"I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. ""Oh that looks kinda like the among us guy"" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than ""sus."" I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is ""red sus"" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word ""among"" is ruined. The phrase ""among us"" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence. MAKE IT STOP!"

Gaming Laptop,"Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops."
